short description
-----------------
The making of a precise measurement requires a likelihood function,
  which is a pdf for the data given the parameters;
  that is, measurement requires a quantitative description of the data-generating process.
If you want to make a measurement using data or information gathered from the literature or the Web,
  you need to be able to quantitatively describe the process by which data is not just created,
  but also published in the literature or on the Web.
That is, it requires a model for the *motivations* of scientific actors.
Here we find some domains or projects in which these issues are highlighted;
  domains in which improvements made to a model of the scientific actors improves the measurements.
